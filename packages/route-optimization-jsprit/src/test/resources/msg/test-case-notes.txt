Open Issues
-------------------------
Issues related to the route optimization:

Time Constraints:

1. What to do when the time constraint is not achievable anymore?
    Example: latest delivery is in the past: 2000-01-01 12:00:00

2. What to do when the time constraints between the bookings are in conflict?
    Example: Two bookings with same delivery window and only one car.

3. Bookings with time constraints will have effects on bookings without time constraint.
    Example: Optimized route is from A->B and it is 06:00 o'clock in the morning. If you set an earliest delivery window to A at 23:00 o'clock the optimized route is still A->B since B has no time constraints. Probably the 'human expection' is, that B is delivered before A on the day?


Costs:

1. Could not find 'distances costs' in the response of OSRM time-distance-matrix request?! (only durations)
