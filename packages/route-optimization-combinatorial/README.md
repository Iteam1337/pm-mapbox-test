# Route Evaluation

AI/Machine learning is the core of the Predictive Movement platform. Various transportation environments (like a passenger-, package- or food-transport by bus, truck or car in rural or city areas) have different requirements to algorithms for optimized transportation. To address this, we are running an integrated "Route Evaluation" beside the Predictive Movement platform, which is specialized for the analyses of transportation data. Solutions for the "Traveling Salesman's Pick-up and Delivery Problem" or "Data-Driven Transportation Forecasting" are developed and evaluated in this project here. The target is to find and to optimize solutions for such routing problems for the Predictive Movement platform.
